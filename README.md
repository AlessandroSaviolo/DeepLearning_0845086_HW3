# Recursive Neural Network for Text Generation

This project is part of a series of projects for the course _Deep Learning_ that I attended during my exchange program at National Chiao Tung University (Taiwan). See `task.pdf` for the details of the assignment. See `report.pdf` for the report containing the representation and the analysis of the produced results.

The purpose of this project is to implement a Recursive Neural Network for Text Generation.
